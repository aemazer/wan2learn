		<p> Wan2Learn is a website dedicated to connecting teachers with students. Any one with a skill or talent who wants to share it can create a Teacher profile and offer their talents to prospective students. Wan2Learn is all about making that connection between the teacher and student. We know it can be hard sometimes to find the right teacher, but not any more! Wan2Learn makes it easy to browse through the different subjects being taught and to make an appointment with a teacher!</p>
